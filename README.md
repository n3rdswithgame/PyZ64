# PyZ64
This is a simple python library for openning Zelda64 n64 roms written in Python (3.6+). Currently it doesn't do much other than open roms and give addresses, but will hopeufly become more featureful as time goes on.

Currently 1.0 uncompressed roms in any of the 3 formats (z64,v64,n64) are the most supported, but other release or debug builds of uncompressed Zelda64 roms are very limitedly supported

## TODO:
*add support for compressed roms
*add support for determining rom type
*expand stored addresses and versions
*add example code
